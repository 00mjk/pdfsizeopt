  pdftex doesn't recompress or change BitsPerComponent, colorspace, filter etc.
  of /XObject
  multivalent doesn't change the BitsPerComponent or colorspace, but it
  changes the filter from none or RLE to /FlateDecode (TODO: what about LZW or
  fax?), but it keeps /DCTDecode.

  including the /Predictor, but it doesn't
  reencode the image; it also removes an unknown /Filter/FooDecode

  The current version of IrfanView can use PNGOUT as an external plug-in,
  obviating the need for a separate compressor.
* However, IrfanView doesn't support transparency, so the image compression
  with IrfanView isn't guaranteed to be lossless. There is also a freeware GUI
  frontend to PNGOUT known as PNGGauntlet.

* OptiPNG is a PNG optimizer that recompresses image files to a smaller
  size, without losing any information. This program also converts external
  formats (BMP, GIF, PNM and TIFF) to optimized PNG, and performs PNG
  integrity checks and corrections.
  If you wish to learn how PNG optimization is done, or to know about other
  similar tools, read the PNG-Tech article "A guide to PNG optimization". 
  (optipng is a redesign of pngcrush)
  * At the time of this writing, AdvPNG does not perform image reductions,
    so the use of pngrewrite or OptiPNG prior to optimiziation may be
    necessary. However, given the effectivenes of 7-Zip deflation, AdvanceCOMP
    is a powerful contender.

  0. Let the original PDF XImage object be orig.pdfimg .
  1. Create v0.pdfimg from orig.pdfimg by keeping only /Width, /Height,
     /ColorSpace, /BitsPerComponent, /Filter and /DecodeParms and the
     compressed stream. Convert ``/ImageMask true'' to /ColorSpace /DeviceGray.
  2. If the /Filter contains /JBIG2Decode or /JPXDecode or /DCTDecode, then
     stop and use v0.pdfimg . (Imp: eliminate /ASCIIHexDecode and
     /ASCII85Decode, also later)
  3. If /ColorSpace is not /DeviceRGB, /DeviceGray or /Indexed of /DeviceRGB
     or /DeviceGray, then stop and use v0.pdfimg . (Imp: /DeviceCMYK, but
     PNG has no support for this).
  4. If /BitsPerComponent is greater than 8, then stop and use v0.pdfimg .
  5. If /Mask is present and it's nonempty, then stop and use v0.pdfimg
     (Imp: easy support for non-indexed /DeviceRGB and /DeviceGray: convert
     the /Mask to RGB8, remove it, and add it back (properly converted back) to
     the final PDF; pay attention to /Decode differences as well.)
  6. Render v0.pdfimg with Ghostscript to -sDEVICE=ppmraw,
     ``/Interpolate false''
     (or -sDEVICE=pgmraw if /DeviceGray or /Indexed/DeviceGray)
     (Imp: maybe -sDEVICE=pdfwrite with
     the appropriate setpagedevice to produce something uncompressed that
     sam2p understands directly.)
  7. Convert the rendered PNM with sam2p to PDF XObject (-pdf:2 PDF1.2:).
     Use the -s option to prevent the creation of a single-color image
     without an image XObject.
     sam2p by default does:
     * removing unused colors from the palette
     * picking the smallest /ColorSpace and /BitsPerComonent (== SampleFormat)
     * using ZIP compression (/FlateDecode)
     (Imp: improve the /FlateDecode predictor selection algorithm of sam2p)
  8. Extract the image XObject from the PDF created by sam2p to v1.pdfimg .
  9. Convert the rendered PNM with sam2p to PNG. (Imp: optimize with
     SampleFormat RGB1, RGB2 and RGB4) (Imp: if BitsPerComponent is not 8,
     do an alternate conversion, specifing only 8-bit SampleFormats)
  10. Use pngout (or optipng, if pdfout is not available). (Imp: with some
      flags: optipng -o5) (Imp: use pnmtopng, which creates a little bit
      smaller PNG than sam2p because it chooses better predictors)
      (Imp: for some very large images (what is the limit?), pdfout runs out
      of memory (malloc fails) -- prevent that, and use optipng)
  11. Extract the new /Width, /Height, /ColorSpace and /BitsPerComponent
      values from the PNG header, and the palette from the PNG PLTE chunk.
  12. Create v2.pdfimg from v0.pdfimg by replacing /Width, /Height,
      /ColorSpace and /BitsPerComponent from the values extracted above,
      adding the corresponding PNG /DecodeParms, /Filter /FlateDecode and
      replacing the image stream with the contents of the PNG IDAT chunk.
      (Imp: experiment size reduction with /DecodeParms and image data being
      out of sync.) This operation is fast, because no recoding or
      recompression takes place.
  13. Pick the smallest of v*.pdfimg created above.
  14. If not v0.pdfimg was picked, then create the output by taking
      orig.pdfimg and replacing /ColorSpace, /BitsPerComponent,
      /DecodeParms, /Filter and the image stream. Verify that /Width and
      /Height of orig.pdf and the v*.pdfimg picked match.
      (Imp: apply the /Mask color interval, if appropriate.)

    The prediction method we use is to find which method provides the
    smallest value when summing the absolute values of the distances
    from zero, using anything >= 128 as negative numbers.  This is known
    as the "minimum sum of absolute differences" heuristic.  Other
    heuristics are the "weighted minimum sum of absolute differences"
    (experimental and can in theory improve compression), and the "zlib
    predictive" method (not implemented yet), which does test compressions
    of lines using different filter methods, and then chooses the
    (series of) filter(s) that give minimum compressed data size (VERY
    computationally expensive).
